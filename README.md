Music Therapy

Music Therapy will be a website that is meant to help users with their mental health. When a user is feeling down or unpleasant emotions, they can open the Music Therapy website. When the user has open the website, they will see a bunch of emojis to help match what they are feeling. Depending on what emoji the user clicks on, a song regarding that emoji will play to help soothe the user and make them feel better. 

When exploring this repository, you will find all the documents related to this project. So far we have uploaded the proposal and SRS documents, and will upload more as we go through this process.
